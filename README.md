# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview - Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

With PgAdmin 4 and SQL we will determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

The analysis will help prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

The ratio of retirement-ready employees to mentorship_eligible employees is significantly higher.  Each role will have a sufficent number of retirment eligible mentors available.  

Total eligible mentorship-employees by title:

If Pewlett-Hackard were to expand the mentorship years to 1964-1965 this would increase the total eleigible employees to 19,904.  This may help with the transition and prepardness to have additional employees ready to step in and fill available positions.
